    "We have learned early in our journey towards Data Science that it is convenient to keep helpful code around and recycle it. So far, we have learned of at least three ways to recycle code:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *Loops.* Loops facilitate reusing hundreds of operations. Loops allow repeating the same operations over and over avoiding actually copying and pasting the same lines of code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *Functions.* Functions facilitate reusing hundreds of lines of code. Functions allow reusing the same lines of code for different instances ofthe same situation. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *Modules.* Modules allow facilitates reusing hundreds of functions. Modules provide a convenient way to save good work, functions, in an accessible file. Module files can be loaded the, or better imported in the current working python stack and that allow accessing and using the functions saved in the module."
